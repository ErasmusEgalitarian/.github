# The Egalitarian Erasmus Initiative üåç  

Welcome to the **Egalitarian Erasmus Initiative**! We are a collaborative effort within the **Egalitarian SDG Challenge**, part of the **Erasmus+ Programme**, bringing together students from:  
- **University of Bras√≠lia (Brazil)**  
- **Aalborg University (Denmark)**  
- **University of Minho (Portugal)**  
- **Saxion University (Netherlands)**  

Our mission is to develop **engineering and technological solutions** that drive sustainability, particularly in waste management. **We believe young people must be the protagonists for a sustainable future.**

## üå± Our Projects  

### **Educado: Empowering Waste Pickers through Education**  
An Android mobile app designed for waste pickers, offering tailored educational content on finances, health, machinery operations, hygiene, and more. Aiming to enhance learning opportunities and align with **SDG 4: Quality Education**.  

### **Carbon: Reducing the Carbon Footprint**  
A platform to **register waste for pickup and processing**, reducing **organic waste decomposition** and **methane emissions** while promoting **cleaner streets**. Developed for implementation in Bras√≠lia.  

### **DMS: Digital Management System for Waste Cooperatives**  
DMS is a system that connects digital scales to cooperatives, automatically recording the weight of **recyclables**, the earnings of waste pickers, and a **scoring system** that incentivizes recycling while strengthening **trust** between cooperatives and waste pickers while encouraging **recycling efforts**.
